This course is about how you can add the Open Innovation License to your GitHub repository. The Open Innnovation License is centered around open source and the concept of open innovation as well as ethical source.

# Open Innovation License
The Open Innovation Open Source License promotes the idea of technology being used in order to make the world a better place. Not only this, but also many problems people have in regards to many different open source hardware and software offerings are tackled by lots of the terminology of this license. This license is partially inspired by many companies wanting to release technology into the world commercially that can still be used by others. It also aims to be easier to incorporate in terms of just a license file, instead of what can eventually become thousands of headers.

Please make sure to go to repository settings, [here](https://github.com/settings/repositories) and change brach from main to master if you run into any problems.
